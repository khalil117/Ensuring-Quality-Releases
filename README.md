## Instructions

### Login with Azure CLI

Firstly, login to the Azure CLI using:

### Configure the storage account and state backend

Terraform supports the persisting of state in remote storage. See [Tutorial: Store Terraform state in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/store-state-in-azure-storage) for details or follow the instructions below.

Firstly, execute the `create-tf-storage.sh` script:

```bash
bash create-tf-storage.sh
```

Update `terraform/terraform.tfvars` with the Terraform storage account and state backend configuration variables:

- `storage_account_name`: The name of the Azure Storage account
- `container_name`: The name of the blob container
- `key`: The name of the state store file to be created

```bash

    resource_group_name  = "tstate"
    storage_account_name = "tstate00000"
    container_name       = "tstate"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"

```
